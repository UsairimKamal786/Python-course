An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is software that combines commonly used developer tools into a compact GUI (graphical user interface) application. It is a combination of tools like a code editor, code compiler, and code debugger with an integrated terminal.

What is IDE
Integrating features like software editing, building, testing, and packaging in a simple-to-use tool, IDEs help boost developer productivity. IDEs are commonly used by programmers and software developers to make their programming journey smoother.

Why are IDEs important?
One certainly does not need an IDE to code or develop applications. Even a simple text editor like notepad can be used to write code. However, IDEs offer some stunning features that go beyond ordinary editing. By providing frequently used developer tools all in one simple interface, one can directly get on to building their applications without going through the hardship of manually configuring and integrating the development environment.

Common Features of an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
IDEs provide a broad variety of features which typically consist of:

Editor: Typically a text editor can help you write software code by highlighting syntax with visual cues, providing language-specific auto-completion, and checking for bugs as you type.
Compiler: A compiler interprets human-readable code into machine-specific code that can be executed on different operating systems like Linux, Windows, or Mac OS. Most IDEs usually come with built-in compilers for the language it supports.
Debugger: A tool that can assist developers to test and debug their applications and graphically point out the locations of bugs or errors if any.
Build-in Terminal: Terminal is a text-based interface that can be used for interacting with the machine's operating system. Developers can directly run the scripts or commands within an IDE with a built-in terminal/console.
Version Control: Version control helps bring clarity to the development of the software. Some IDEs also support version control tools like Git, through which a user can track and manage the changes to the software code.
Code snippets: IDEs support code snippets that are usually used to accomplish a single task and can also reduce redundant work to some great extent.
Extensions and Plugins: Extensions and Plugins are used to extend the functionality of the IDEs with respect to specific programming languages. 
Code navigation: IDEs come with tools like code folding, class and method navigation, and refactoring tools that make it simple to go through and analyze code.
Why do Developers Use IDE (Integrated Development Environment)?
By providing a single, unified environment for managing all aspects of the development process, IDEs can help improve a developer's productivity, code quality, and overall development experience. 

Productivity: By combining common activities such as editing code, building executables, debugging, and testing as part of software/application development, IDEs help by reducing time and increasing overall productivity.
Code Quality: IDEs come with built-in tools as a part of a single GUI, through which developers can execute actions without switching between applications. Furthermore, it can also help in Syntax highlighting, code refactoring, and code analysis boosting overall code quality.
Integrated Environment: IDEs come pre-built with a combination of development tools that allow developers to start programming new applications quickly. With IDEs, it is no longer necessary to manually configure and integrate numerous utilities as part of the setup procedure. Additionally, since every utility is available on the same workbench, developers don't have to spend hours learning how to use each one separately.
Customizability: By incorporating customization options ranging from custom color schemes, and keyboard shortcuts, to choosing unique layouts, different plugins, and add-ons;  IDEs enable developers to customize their environment to their unique needs and tastes, improving the comfort and efficiency of the development process.
