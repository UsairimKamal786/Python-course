***What is Python***

Python is a popular programming language that is easy to learn and use. It is an interpreted, high-level language, which means that you donâ€™t need to worry about complex computer instructions. Python is also object-oriented, meaning it helps organise code using objects, which makes building programs easier.

Python is known for having a simple and clean style, so the code looks more like regular English. This makes it great for beginners who are just starting to learn programming. It is used in many areas like making websites, apps, games, and even in science, robotics, and artificial intelligence.

Because Python is easy to read and understand, people can work together on Python projects more easily. It also saves time when fixing or changing the code later. That's why Python is one of the most loved and widely used programming languages in the world.
